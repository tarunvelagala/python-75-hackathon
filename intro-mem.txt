MEMORY MANAGEMENT BY PVM:

        Memory allocation and deallocation are done by PVM during runtime.Entire memory is allocated on heap.

We know that actual memory (RAM)for any program is allocated by the underlying operating system.
On the top of the operating system,a raw meory allocator oversees whether enough memory is available to it for storing the objects(ex:integers,functions,lists,modules etc).
On the top of the raw memory allocator,there are several object-specific allocators operate on the same heap.
For example,an integer number should be stored in tuples and dictionaries,they should be stored differently.
These issues are taken care by OBJECT SPECIFIC MEMORY ALLOCATORS.
